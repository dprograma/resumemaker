I need to created an application `replicated_resume.html` to use `C:\resumemaker\Senior-Software-Developer-Resume1-Resume-Editor-02-06-2025_12_57_PM_page-0001.jpg` and `C:\resumemaker\Senior-Software-Developer-Resume2-Resume-Editor-02-06-2025_12_56_PM_page-0001.jpg` as samples for resume template. This application will have a button for edit mode and a download pdf button to download the resume in pdf format. The `replicated_resume.html` is existing but is pooerly built. I want it to have a perfect match in design, style, formatting and layout with the samples I've given above. Also, the pdf download must have a perfect match with the edited document with good margin, the text properly fitted into the pdf document. Show me your plan of implementation before you proceed.
